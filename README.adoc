ladici - The LADI Continuous Integration software

.WORK IN PROGRESS
[NOTE]
This is Work In Progress.

Goals:

 * Minimal dependencies
 ** lua
 ** luasocket
 ** fengari (optional, for the client-side scripting frontend)
 * IRC based LPC/RPC
 * no database. Use lua files for configuration. Use filesystem symlinks & hardlinks where a simple filesystem tree is not enough.

Concepts:

 * ladici HQ - the central machine/node
 * ladici factory - a machine/node (can be the HQ one) where lanes are hosted
 * ladici lane - a chain or DAG of rules & commands to be executed by ladici factories

In simplest case, ladici deployment consists of single machine/node running ladici. The process running HQ can also run a factory and is pre-configured so with one that runs lane to create tarballs from sources.
