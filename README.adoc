ladici - The LADI Continuous Integration software

.WORK IN PROGRESS
[NOTE]
This is Work In Progress.

Goals:

 * Minimal dependencies
 ** lua
 ** luasocket
 ** fengari (optional, for the client-side scripting frontend)
 * IRC based LPC/RPC
 * no database. Use lua files for configuration. Use filesystem symlinks & hardlinks where a simple filesystem tree is not enough.

Concepts:

 * ladici HQ - the central machine/node
 * ladici factory - a machine/node (can be the HQ one) where lanes are hosted
 * ladici lane - a chain or DAG of rules & commands to be executed by ladici factories

In simplest case, ladici deployment consists of single machine/node running ladici. The process running HQ can also run a factory and is pre-configured so with one that runs lane to create tarballs from sources.

Usage:

Running "./ladici hq" from source checkout will start the HQ node.
By default HQ node comes with a HTTP server listening at 127.0.0.1:8010 for read-only HTML server-side scripting generated view.

To run the client-side scripting in WWW browser with JavaScript:

 * Obtain a copy of "fengary-web.js". fengary-web-0.1.4 can be downloaded from https://github.com/fengari-lua/fengari-web/releases/download/v0.1.4/fengari-web.js
 * Copy fengari-web.js to the same directory that will serve ladici-fengari.html and ladici-fengari.lua
 * Setup web server to serve static content of the directory where ladici-fengari.html and ladici-fengari.lua and fengari-web.js reside and make ladici-fengari.html the default document.
